- 👋 Hi, I’m @ron okoren
- 👀 I’m interested in elecronics, electronic repair, audio and video, and controls. I recently aquired a Harmony Hub and Remote and after spending days programming it, have found it to be quite unsatifactory. Joined Github with the idea that I maybe I could improve it and download my own changes to it, using its open source code and GitHub tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet - want to learn
- 📫 How to reach me
